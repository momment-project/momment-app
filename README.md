# momment-app
Momment App for Android

The Momment App open-source project is intended to be a turning point in how news and information are exchanged between contacts, including fake news detection.
The service is intended to be supported by a decentralized peer-to-peer network, in order to be fast, transparent and reliable, however a first approach could be possibly centralized (keeping fully open-source spirit and reproducible in independent servers).

Feel free to join us!
